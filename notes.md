## Code Tracker - Abe Brege
## Outline
Like Strava for programmers. Can track users time programming, show graphs, have ability to see other profiles, along with weekly, yearly, and daily stats. <br><br>

There is a hole in services that track someones progress coding like Github. It tracks commits, and has some okay stats, but it doesn't track other metrics like time spent a day programming, projects completed, milestones reached, etc. This goes for Leetcode as well. While Leetcode does have better graphics, and shares the idea of achievements, daily check-ins, and the social media aspect, etc., it still falls short on time spent programming, and other vital features in other tracking apps. Likewise, both Github and Leetcode fall short on a functionality, or even need to show stats from the other. This is another thing that this app would accomplish. Not only would it track new types of stats, it would bridge the gap of Leetcode and Github, displaying stats from those websites as well.
